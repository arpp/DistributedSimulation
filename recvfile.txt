Hi GATE community,

I've just noticed a lot of ppl (including me!) having problems running GATE outside of the GUI; basically wanting to run it as a standalone program.

So.. I've written a simple program which essentially implements the "Goldfish" example in the User Guide for GATE (see http://www.gate.ac.uk/sale/tao/index.html#x1-220002.7) as well as adding a couple of extras. Note that I didn't use the BOOTSTRAP WIZARD from the GATE GUI; personally, it was easier for me to start from scratch. Another example of a standalone application can be found at (http://gate.ac.uk/GateExamples/doc/java2html/sheffield/examples/StandAloneAnnie.java.html).

Firstly, you should have a file called "goldfishExample.zip" attached. Unzip it to a directory.

Getting it running
------------------
*) From the GATE GUI
   
== RUNNING THE PROCESSING RESOURCES ==

		1) Start GATE
		2) From the File menu, choose "Load a CREOLE repository", and select the directory where you unpacked the contents of the zip file.
		3) Load the "ANNIE English Tokenizer", "ANNIE Sentence Splitter" and the "Goldfish Counter" processing resources (PR).
		4) Load a language resource (LR), namely "testFile.txt" which you should find in that same directory.
		5) Create a new pipeline and order the processing resources in the order stated in step (3) above.
		6) After setting the LR for each PR, hit "Run"!

== VIEWING THE RESULTS ==
   
Go and view the document and click the "Annotation Sets" button. Under "Default annotations" on the right, you should see 5 annotations including "Goldfish". BTW, if the background colour of "Goldfish" is too light to see, you can double click on it to change it. OK.. now ticking "Goldfish" you should see the obvious. Now untick Goldfish, and tick "Sentence". Then click the "Annotations" button. You should now see the number of times "Goldfish" occurs in every sentence. Oh yeah, and by clicking on the column title entitled "Start", the sentence annotations will be ordered by their appearance in the actual text.

If you click on the "Features Editor" tab at the bottom of the GUI, you should see the simple 'extras' I added on.

*) From the command line (standalone application)

Open a command line terminal, and navigate to the directory where you unpacked "goldfishExample.zip". If you're in the right place, you should see "goldfish.jar" in there. OK... now you 'just' have to type something like:

java -cp goldfish.jar:/research/gate/bin/gate.jar:/usr/local/share/j2sdk1.4.0/lib/tools.jar TotalGoldfishCount testFile.txt

Ok, now the explanation as to what that means:

For the classpath, you need to include 3 things:
	1) goldfish.jar
	2) gate.jar
	3) tools.jar - this will no longer be necessary in GATE 2.1_02. For now (GATE 2.1), if you don't include it, you'll get the following error message:

        Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/tools/javac/v8/JavaCompiler

"TotalGoldfishCount" is the name of the standalone application that calls the GATE (and my) PR's. 

"testFile.txt" is the name of the file you want to process. BTW, you can list as many files as you want after "TotalGoldfishCount".. it'll process them all. Just be wary of memory limitations.

Checking out the code.. how does it work??
------------------------------------------

Well, obviously you're gonna have to first unpack "goldfish.jar". The files you'll want to look at are:

      *) TotalGoldfishCount.java -- the standalone application
      *) andrewgolightly/nlp/gate/prs/Goldfish.java -- my PR
      *) creole.xml

It's really up to you to understand the code. This little system was just meant to help out a bit :)

All the best!
